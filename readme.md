# Wallies - A Wallpaper App

Welcome to Wallies! I've always wanted a light weight app that would pull in nice fresh wallpapers every day, so I made one.

This app is intended to serve as a source for rotating wallpapers, and screensaver images. (If you set your wallpaper folder and screensaver folder to the same one.)

This app will pull in wall papers from [here](https://wallhaven.cc/hot). If you have an account there, this app will use your search preferences you have saved. (Given an API key.)


## Requirements:
- Python 3.6+ installed on your machine.
- You will likely want an account on https://wallhaven.cc/, and to save some custom search settings. These will be used when the script runs and pull in wall papers of your choosing.

## Installation:
- Clone/download this repo locally.
- In a terminal window navigate to this dir and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set this script to run every time you turn on your computer!
